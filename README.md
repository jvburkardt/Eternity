<em>Eternity</em> is a collection of computer programs which uses linear programming techniques to model the Eternity puzzle, and more 
generally, Eternity type puzzles. See

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_puzzle

and the 1st paper referenced below (associated with the computer programs in this paper). The MATLAB codes generate the linear programming
model for a given puzzle. To obtain a tiling solution, an integer programming package, such as CPLEX, GUROBI, or SCIP, must be invoked to
obtain solutions which are binary (only 0 or 1).

<b>Languages:</b>

<em>Eternity</em> is available here in a MATLAB version.
